# Journey

A crowd-sourced static road hazard finder


## Notice

Development on Journey has been placed on hold. Predator, an entirely separate program developed by V0LT, has features planned to replace the functionality of Journey.


## Disclaimer

Journey is currently very early in development. Everything you read here is subject to change. Journey is currently just a proof of concept, and is fairly impractical for real world use. Always pay attention to the road and your surroundings while driving, and never depend on a piece of software to replace your own discretion and decision making.


## Description

As a driver on the road, you have countless things to keep track of. You're responsible for watching the movement of pedestrians, wildlife, and even other drivers. As anyone who's driven on a main road will know, it's an almost impossible task to keep track of every single moving object in a given situation, let alone do so while also watching for construction zones, police, road damage, and other potential static hazards.

This is where Journey comes in. Journey uses a crowd-sourced database of static road hazards to help keep you aware of the road ahead without diverting your attention from your immediate surroundings. Instead of being surprised by a lane of damage road, or a construction zone around a turn, Journey makes sure you know what's coming before you're forced to make a potentially dangerous split second judgment.


## Features

### Open Source

Unlike all other crowdsourced traffic hazard programs, Journey is completely and 100% open source. In other words, you're completely free to inspect and modify the code that powers it to ensure that your privacy, freedom, and security are all protected.

### Safety

When used correctly, Journey helps you be more aware of your surroundings and the road ahead of you while driving. Driving is easily the most dangerous activity you do on a regular basis, and yet many people don't give it the focus it deserves. Journey is for those drivers who want to know as much about what's ahead as possible so they can focus on whats more important: Keeping themselves and those around them safe.

### Privacy Respecting

Journey isn't run by an advertising company interested in collecting your personal information. It's run by V0LT, and doesn't contain trackers or ads of any kind.

### Self Hosted

While you'll lose out on the potential benefits of a crowdsourced network, Journey is completely self-hostable, ensuring the utmost privacy and security.
